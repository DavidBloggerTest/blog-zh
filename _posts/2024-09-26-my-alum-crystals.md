On Monday, I participated in the Chemistry Lab class and our first experiment (not exactly a chemistry one) was to make alum crystals.

$$
50g\space H_2O+12g\space KAl(SO_4)_2\cdot12H_2O
$$

After heating and stirring (we used an incredible heater & stirrer called IKA. It was extremely fast but because the raw alum was in big chunks it still took some time), we took our solutions back and let the crystals grow.

In the first two days, nothing happened. So, today, I shook the bottle violently (to disturb the solution and start crystallization). But the crystallization was too violent and I ended up with a lot of tiny, irregular crystals filling the bottom.

Although it wasn\'t exactly successful, the pictures are still quite good.

Enjoy!
